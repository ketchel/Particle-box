# Particle Box
This is a class that simulates collisions of particles in a 2D box. It also includes a way to animate the simulation.
An example animation can be found under the name Particle_Box.mp4.
This class can be used to show many interesting physical phenomena, such as plotting a histogram of the velocities
to show that they follow a Maxwellian distribution. It can also be used to show how variables such as temperature,
mass, pressure, or number of particles impacts the system as a whole. Since all these variables are included, the class
can also be used to prove the ideal gas law, PV = NRT. Or just watch a cool animation of circles bouncing around a box.
